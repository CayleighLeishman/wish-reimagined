So I decided to make the page name for the wish displays "Magnifico's vault" as a cheeky reference to the movie. I love the idea even if it is a little vilanous. I had to explain it to Avalon, but they understood the reference after a little clarification.

things I did:
- added wishes-made and magnifico-s-vault (Magnifoco's Vault)
- tried to add some accessibility features. 
    still not sure how to get it to activly work, but I got it from Whimsica11y's website and hope to be able to figure it out. 
-add credits page 


Thigns Avalon did (That I'm aware of)"
- wrote script for act 1
- rewrote "this wish" and changed title to "I wish"
- gave feedback on color scheme (at My request)
