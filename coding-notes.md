This is where I plan to put my codng thoughts and comments. See this programmers thought process!!

So I originally did the work in static html, but tI lost inspiration for the design because it cameoff too.... bland for me. likeit was cute, but not anything eye catching and I just felt "wrong" and "stuck"

so I went to chatgpt seeking logical solutions to see if i can do somethjing and then with that I realized that I could make this in Svetlecomponents. 

So dear reader, I decided to put everything into "old proj" and did just that!

I also struggled with the design layout of the site so that will take a minute!

But nce I get an idea of how it looks I'll take a picture and share it on the md file here

[](insert-link-to-img)

Tada! So this is draft 2 of the site to see if I can figure out what was "missing" frm the previous site.


oaky so i made quite a few decisions
heres a recap:
I'm going to useAWs, lambda for their free teir function plan



I'm going to double check that its free, but ti sounds like it hould be. So thats good
I'm giong to use the database that's attached to lambda 

I'll use netlify to host the websited 


and I'll design the website with the main characteron left, and starboy on the right bottom page. And maybe ket the footer be visible and look like grass? 

ther will be shooting stars every 60 seconds, at least three

So I decided to make the page name for the wish displays "Magnifico's vault" as a cheeky reference to the movie. I love the idea even if it is a little vilanous. I had to explain it to Avalon, but they understood the reference after a little clarification.

things I did:
- added wishes-made and magnifico-s-vault (Magnifoco's Vault)
- tried to add some accessibility features. 
    still not sure how to get it to activly work, but I got it from Whimsica11y's website and hope to be able to figure it out. 
-add credits page 


Thigns Avalon did (That I'm aware of)"
- wrote script for act 1
- rewrote "this wish" and changed title to "I wish"
- gave feedback on color scheme (at My request)
