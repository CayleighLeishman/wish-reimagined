This project is a fun way for me and my friend to reference to our fun project where we (cough)Avalon(cough) rewrote how we would like the movie to go. 

Keep in mind, this is just a reference. I was inspired to create a website where we made homage to the original movie and put our own spin on it. 

This website is meant as a fun way to engage anyone who likes to enjoy seeing what other peole are working on in a more writing creative format. We all have different creative talents, and we wanted to express that in our own way.

We hope you enjoy this fun project we're doing!
